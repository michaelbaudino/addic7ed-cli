# TODO

Here is a list of future features I'd like to implement:

* [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the CLI (maybe: file sharing might be an UX issue)
* [ ] Support directory parsing
* [ ] Document usage with cron
* [ ] Document usage with iwatch

> :innocent: It's also an interesting list of tasks to pickup if you'd like to contribute.
